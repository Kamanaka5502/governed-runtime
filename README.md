# Governed Runtime

## Overview
Governed Runtime is an iterative simulation exploring stability-driven behavioral convergence through continuous runtime cycles.

The system models:
- Stabilization (damping)
- Controlled learning drift
- Emergence dynamics
- Long-run convergence behavior

This project is intended for reproducible runtime observation.
