# Governed Runtime

Adaptive governance runtime designed around stability-driven intelligence.

This project models layered decision systems that regulate pressure,
intervention, continuity, and adaptive closure.

---

## Core Concept

The runtime behaves like a self-regulating system:

- Detect instability
- Classify risk patterns
- Adjust intervention
- Reduce correction over time
- Move toward equilibrium

Layers represent progressive control structures.

## Project Structure

- `governed_runtime.py` — primary runtime entry
- `layerXX_*.py` — modular governance layers
- `run_all.py` — executes full stack
- `tests/` — validation scripts

---

## Layer Philosophy (Short Version)

Early layers:
- pressure control
- boundaries
- recovery

Middle layers:
- governance feedback
- explainability
- trajectory monitoring

Late layers:
- stability confirmation
- adaptive memory
- closure / equilibrium

---

## Running

```bash
python run_all.py
