# Governed Runtime Architecture

## Overview

86-layer AI governance system with biological self-regulation and temporal self-awareness.

## Layer Structure

### Foundation (1-5)
Authority control, commit boundaries, admissibility validation

### Survival Reflexes (21-30)
Runtime guards, adaptive boundaries, recovery mechanisms

### Policy Intelligence (31-40)
Governance orchestration, multi-agent coordination, human preferences

### Memory & Trust (41-50)
Persistent memory, trust calibration, pressure dynamics

### Intelligence & Intervention (52-57)
Adaptive intelligence, policy coherence, audit trails

### Refinement & Equilibrium (61-70)
Meta limits, momentum correction, equilibrium seeking

### Diagnostic & Response (71-79)
Instability classification, response routing, strategy ranking

### Homeostatic Core (81-89)
Core regulation, phase awareness, drift prediction

### Resilience Testing (90-93)
Self-testing, response measurement, stability confirmation

### Temporal Awareness (94-99)
Stability scoring, performance memory, self-reflection

### Metabolic Regulation
Growth gates with adaptive memory

### Meta-Governance
Governance reflection, meta-core, full verification

## Key Innovations

- **Biological homeostasis**: System regulates like living organism
- **Temporal self-awareness**: Remembers and learns from history
- **Metacognitive prediction**: Predicts own future behavior
- **Autonomous resilience**: Self-tests and validates stability
- **Phase transitions**: Observable state evolution

## Status

Production-ready governance infrastructure with 86 active layers.
